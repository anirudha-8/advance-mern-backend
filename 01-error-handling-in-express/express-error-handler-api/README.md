# Express Error Handling Project

This project demonstrates **production-ready error handling in Express**:

- Centralized error middleware
- Custom error class for operational errors
- Async wrapper for route handlers
- Mongoose and JWT error handling
- Environment-based error responses
- Logging integration with Winston

## Scripts

- Change the directory: `cd 01-error-handling-in-express/express-error-handler-api`

- `npm run dev` → start development server with nodemon

- `npm start` → start server normally

## Project Goal

To build a **robust and maintainable backend API** that gracefully handles errors, provides meaningful messages, and supports developer debugging in a production-ready environment.
