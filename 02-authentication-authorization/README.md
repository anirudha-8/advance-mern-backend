# 🪪 Authentication & Authorization — README

## 📖 Overview

- This module covers Authentication and Authorization, two core aspects of backend security in the MERN stack.

- The goal is to understand how to verify users (AuthN) and control access (AuthZ) using secure, production-grade techniques.

---

## 🧩 Key Learning Outcomes

### ✅ Authentication (AuthN)

- Verifying user identity using credentials (email, password, tokens, or OAuth providers).

- Understanding different authentication methods:

  - Cookie & Session-based (Stateful)

  - JWT-based (Stateless)

  - OAuth-based (Third-party sign-in)

### ✅ Authorization (AuthZ)

- Managing what a user can or cannot access after login.

- Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using middleware.

### ✅ Security Enhancements

- Encrypting passwords using bcrypt (with salting).

- Using jsonwebtoken (JWT) for stateless authentication.

- Managing access tokens and refresh tokens.

- Implementing secure cookies and sessions with express-session.

- Understanding Passport.js for local and third-party authentication (Google OAuth).

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

- Use HTTPS and secure cookies in production.

- Store all secrets (like JWT_SECRET, SESSION_SECRET) in .env files.

- Implement rate limiting on login and signup endpoints.

- Always use HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS.

- Validate inputs and sanitize all data.

- Use short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

1. Reinforce your understanding through 10 quiz questions (Step 3).

2. Implement a small practice problem (signup/login + JWT + protect route).

3. Build a mini-project (User Authentication System with RBAC).

Each implementation step will be guided by best practices and real-world conventions, with reviews after each stage

---

## 🪴 Reflection

- This module builds the foundation for secure user systems — a must-have skill for every full-stack developer.

- By mastering this, you’ll be confident to design authentication flows like in real-world SaaS apps (login, logout, tokens, roles, permissions).
